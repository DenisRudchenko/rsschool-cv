## About me 
I'm a logistics specialist. For the last 4 years I have worked for an international shipping company. I decided to change my specialty, as it became uninteresting to me. I like programming. I'm sure that in this area you can constantly develop to infinity. I would like to work in a team, create cool projects and develop. My goal is to learn Javascript and become an excellent specialist. I will be glad to get on a project under the guidance of a good developer to gain invaluable experience. Among my strengths, I would like to highlight high resistance to stress, the ability to cope with a large amount of work, competently plan and find a common language with people.
